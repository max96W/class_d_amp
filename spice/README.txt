As I do not want to upload SPICE models from manufacturers or other people here, please download them by yourself and place them in the libs directory like this:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiggleport/wiggle-spine/master/doc/ltspice-simulations/lib/74hct.lib -> 74HCT.LIB 
https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irfb4020pbf.spi?fileId=5546d462533600a4015357121aa23952 -> IRFB4020.LIB 
http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/sbom071 -> OPA350.LIB 
http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/slum504 -> UCC27211.LIB

Please also note that the simulation schematics are not up to date with the actual design.
